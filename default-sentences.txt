A bitterness crept into her face
A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light
A book to beguile the tedious hours
A brave but turbulent aristocracy
A broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips
A burlesque feint of evading a blow
A callous and conscienceless brute
A calm and premeditated prudence
A calmness settled on his spirit
A campaign of unbridled ferocity
A carefully appraising eye
A ceaselessly fleeting sky
A certain implication of admiring confidence
A charming air of vigor and vitality
A childish belief in his own impeccability
A dandified, pretty-boy-looking sort of figure
A dark and relentless fate
A day monotonous and colorless
A dazzling completeness of beauty
A deep and brooding resentment
A delicious throng of sensations
A deliciously tantalizing sense
A detached segment of life
A dire monotony of bookish idiom
A disheveled and distraught figure
A face singularly acute and intelligent
A faint accent of reproach
A faint sense of compunction moved her
A faint, transient, wistful smile lightened her brooding face
A faint tremor of amusement was on his lips
A faintly quizzical look came into his incisive stare
A fawn-colored sea streaked here and there with tints of deepest orange
A fever of enthusiasm
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain
A figure full of decision and dignity
A firm and balanced manhood
A first faint trace of irritation
A fitful boy full of dreams and hopes
A flame of scarlet crept in a swift diagonal across his cheeks
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph
A flood of pride rose in him
A foreboding of some destined change
A fortuitous series of happy thoughts
A frigid touch of the hand
A fugitive intangible charm
A generation of men lavishly endowed with genius
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
A ghastly whiteness overspread the cheek
A glance of extraordinary meaning
A glassy expression of inattention
A glassy stare of deprecating horror
A glittering infectious smile
A gloom overcame him
A golden haze of pensive light
A golden summer of marvelous fertility
A graceful readiness and vigor
A grave man of pretending exterior
A great pang gripped her heart
A great process of searching and shifting
A great sickness of heart smote him
